## ðŸ§  How the Logic Works

- **Dynamic Turns**: Supports variable number of players (`X`, `O`, `â–³`, etc.)
- **Revolving Board**: Keeps a track of all move indices; deletes the oldest after `players.length * 3` moves.
- **Win Check**: Scans only for 3-in-a-row horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
